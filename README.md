###  👊  Hello there, I'm Peter Herbel
  
☁️ Cloud Architect and founder of [GetTech](https://github.com/GetTech-io). Huge fan of :octocat: GitHub and Open Source Software.  
I'm father of two 👶 which is my best journey in my life. 🏡 We live in Budapest, Hungary with my family.

📓 I'm learning (as always) Azure, cloud technologies, distributed systems, .NET and C# tricks, architecture patterns, DevOps principles and how we can be an efficient Agile organization with modern mindset.

💬 Ask me about: [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet), [ASP.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore), [Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)  
😄 Fun fact: I like to play with my children, travel, and cook. ⚽ I'm Manchester United fan.
